# Object-LT
An object-based change detection method using Landsat TS

This is the code used in the article《Object-based change detection for vegetation disturbance and recovery using Landsat time series》

注意：原文中的图10在文章online后被编辑删掉了，我不懂他为何要这样做，但我认为这幅图对于解释和证明Object-LT方法的效果十分必要。图10与章节4.3的最后一段话相对应

Note: Figure 10 in the original article was removed by the editor after the article was ONLINE, I don't understand why he did it, but I think this figure is necessary to explain and prove the effectiveness of the Object-LT method. Figure 10 corresponds to the last paragraph of section 4.3.
